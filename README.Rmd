### Examples

These are basic examples which show you how to use fungai:

using a prompt with information you have about the mushroom:
```{r example}
library(fungai)

fungai::fungai(llm_model = "llama3.2-vision",
               prompt    = "hello fungai,
                         I'm trying to identify an orange mushroom that has no gills.
                         it has gill-like ridges, but i think it's a polypore.
                         i found it growing out of the ground in the woods.
                         Cap 5 cm across, stem 7 cm tall * 1 cm thick, 
                         can you reference your dictionary and help me identify it?"
               ) |> cat()
```


using an image of the mushroom:
```{r}
fungai::fungai(llm_model = "llama3.2-vision",
               prompt    = ellmer::content_image_file(
                             path   = system.file("images", "6.png", package = "fungai"), 
                             resize = "high"
                             )
               ) |> cat()
```

more generic mushroom questions:
```{r}
fungai::fungai(llm_model = "llama3.3", 
               prompt = "hello fungai! what mushrooms are found in the US Rocky Mountains?")
```


```{r}
fungai::fungai(llm_model = "llama3.3", 
               prompt = "hello fungai! can you give me a cool new mycelium catch phrase?")
```
